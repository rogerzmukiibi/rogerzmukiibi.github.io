I have tried blogging for long, atleast from the time I fancied making personal websites. This year I even got my domain, but truth be said I dont have things to put here. 

But I think I have things to put here, the only problem is that i never get the time to write the content for this page. I always have alot to say but the excuses I have outway my need to write. 

The excuses range from not feeling the urge to write to not having time to sit down, sometimes its not having a perfect notebook or even failign to implement a perfect site. 

Today i have devided not to even write a draft, just so that I can put something up here, no need to wait for my lazy side to implement analytics on this page. Hopefully I am able to push this and it works the way I want it. I have always thought I am the move fast break and fix later but I my levels of procrastination prove otherwise.

Anyway, the blog is in a very bad shape, most links are not working but here we are.
