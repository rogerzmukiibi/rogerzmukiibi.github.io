# Getting Started with Web Development

Web development is an exciting field that combines creativity with technical skills. Whether you're looking to build websites, web applications, or pursue a career in tech, understanding the fundamentals is crucial.

## What is Web Development?

Web development involves creating and maintaining websites and web applications. It encompasses everything from simple static pages to complex dynamic applications that millions of people use daily.

## The Three Pillars

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML provides the structure and content of web pages. It's like the skeleton of a webpage.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
CSS handles the presentation and styling. It's what makes websites look beautiful and responsive.

```css
body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 20px;
}

h1 {
    color: #333;
    text-align: center;
}
```

### JavaScript
JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.

```javascript
function greetUser() {
    const name = prompt("What's your name?");
    alert("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```
